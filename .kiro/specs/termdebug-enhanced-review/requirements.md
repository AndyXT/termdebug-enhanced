# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for reviewing and improving the termdebug-enhanced Neovim plugin. The plugin extends Neovim's built-in termdebug functionality with VSCode-like debugging features for embedded development. Based on the code analysis, several issues have been identified that need to be addressed to improve code quality, maintainability, and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the plugin, I want clean, properly formatted code without linting issues, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is analyzed by LuaLS THEN there SHALL be no undefined global `vim` warnings
2. WHEN the code is analyzed by LuaLS THEN there SHALL be no unused local variables or functions
3. WHEN the code is analyzed by LuaLS THEN there SHALL be no lines with trailing spaces or spaces-only lines
4. WHEN the code is analyzed by LuaLS THEN there SHALL be no deprecated function usage (like `unpack`)
5. WHEN the code is analyzed by LuaLS THEN there SHALL be proper type annotations for all parameters

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the plugin, I want proper error handling and validation, so that the plugin behaves predictably and provides helpful feedback when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GDB communication fails THEN the plugin SHALL provide clear error messages to the user
2. WHEN invalid memory addresses are accessed THEN the plugin SHALL handle the error gracefully
3. WHEN breakpoint operations fail THEN the plugin SHALL notify the user with specific error details
4. WHEN the plugin configuration is invalid THEN the plugin SHALL validate and warn about issues during setup
5. WHEN async operations timeout THEN the plugin SHALL provide appropriate feedback and cleanup resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working on the plugin, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN all critical functions SHALL have unit tests
2. WHEN tests are run THEN edge cases and error conditions SHALL be covered
3. WHEN tests are run THEN the memory module SHALL have dedicated test coverage
4. WHEN tests are run THEN the keymaps module SHALL have test coverage for keymap setup/cleanup
5. WHEN tests are run THEN async operations SHALL be properly tested with mocks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the plugin, I want optimized performance and resource management, so that the plugin doesn't impact my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is active THEN unused functions SHALL be removed or marked as used
2. WHEN memory windows are created THEN they SHALL be properly cleaned up when closed
3. WHEN GDB buffer caching is used THEN cache invalidation SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN floating windows are created THEN they SHALL not leak resources
5. WHEN the plugin is disabled THEN all resources SHALL be properly cleaned up

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer extending the plugin, I want well-documented and structured code, so that I can understand and modify the plugin easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN all public functions SHALL have proper LuaLS type annotations
2. WHEN reviewing the code THEN complex functions SHALL have clear documentation
3. WHEN reviewing the code THEN module dependencies SHALL be clearly defined
4. WHEN reviewing the code THEN configuration options SHALL be properly documented
5. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the plugin architecture SHALL follow consistent patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user of the plugin, I want reliable debugging functionality, so that I can effectively debug my embedded applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using breakpoint toggle THEN it SHALL correctly detect existing breakpoints
2. WHEN evaluating expressions THEN the results SHALL be displayed in properly formatted popups
3. WHEN viewing memory THEN the hex dump SHALL be correctly formatted and navigable
4. WHEN editing memory THEN the changes SHALL be validated and applied correctly
5. WHEN using keymaps THEN they SHALL be properly set up and cleaned up during debug sessions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer deploying the plugin, I want proper configuration validation, so that setup issues are caught early and clearly communicated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is configured THEN debugger executable availability SHALL be validated
2. WHEN GDB init files are specified THEN their existence SHALL be checked and warnings provided
3. WHEN invalid configuration options are provided THEN clear error messages SHALL be shown
4. WHEN the plugin starts THEN termdebug availability SHALL be verified
5. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL be validated before application
