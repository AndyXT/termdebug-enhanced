# Termdebug Enhanced - Issue Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Breakpoint Toggle Issue (F9 key)**
**Problem**: F9 shows "No breakpoints, watchpoints, etc..." error instead of setting breakpoint

**Root Cause**: The code incorrectly treated GDB's "No breakpoints" response as an error instead of a normal response indicating no breakpoints exist.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Modified `lua/termdebug-enhanced/keymaps.lua`
- Changed logic to properly handle "No breakpoints" response
- Added proper detection for when no breakpoints exist vs actual errors

**Before (BROKEN)**:
```lua
if error then
    if error:match("[Nn]o breakpoints") then
        -- This never triggered because "No breakpoints" comes as response, not error
```

**After (FIXED)**:
```lua
-- Check if response indicates no breakpoints exist
local no_breakpoints = false
if response and #response > 0 then
    local response_text = table.concat(response, " ")
    if response_text:match("[Nn]o breakpoints") or response_text:match("[Nn]o watchpoints") then
        no_breakpoints = true
    end
else
    no_breakpoints = true
end
```

### 2. **Evaluate Feature Issue (K key)**
**Problem**: K key doesn't show popup window (results appear in GDB terminal but no floating popup)

**Root Cause**: Multiple potential issues in popup creation and callback handling

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added debug logging to trace execution flow
- Enhanced error handling in popup creation
- Added verification that callbacks are being called
- Improved window positioning and creation logic

**Debug Features Added**:
- Callback execution logging
- Window creation success/failure logging
- Buffer creation verification
- Response processing logging

## How to Test the Fixes

### **Test Breakpoint Toggle (F9)**
1. Start debugging: `:TermdebugStart your_program`
2. Place cursor on a line with code
3. Press F9 - should see: "Breakpoint 1 set at file:line"
4. Press F9 again on same line - should see: "Breakpoint 1 removed from file:line"

### **Test Evaluate Feature (K)**
1. Start debugging and hit a breakpoint
2. Place cursor on a variable
3. Press K
4. Check for:
   - Floating popup with variable value
   - Debug messages in `:messages`
   - If no popup appears, check debug output

### **Debug Commands Available**
```vim
:Evaluate variable_name    " Manual evaluation
:EvaluateCursor           " Evaluate under cursor
:MemoryView 0x1234        " View memory
:TermdebugDiagnose        " Show diagnostics
```

## Debugging Steps

### **If Breakpoint Toggle Still Fails**
1. Check if debugging session is active: `:echo g:termdebug_running`
2. Verify GDB communication: `:lua vim.fn.TermdebugCommand("info breakpoints")`
3. Check messages: `:messages`

### **If Evaluate Popup Still Doesn't Appear**
1. Enable debug logging: `:lua vim.log.set_level(vim.log.levels.DEBUG)`
2. Try evaluate: Press K on a variable
3. Check debug messages: `:messages`
4. Look for:
   - "Evaluate callback called for: variable_name"
   - "Got GDB response with X lines"
   - "Creating popup with X lines"
   - "Popup created successfully: win=X, buf=Y"

### **Manual Testing**
```lua
-- Test popup creation directly
:lua require("termdebug-enhanced.evaluate").evaluate_custom("1+1")

-- Test GDB communication
:lua require("termdebug-enhanced.utils").async_gdb_response("help", function(r,e) print("Response:", r and #r or "nil", "Error:", e) end)
```

## Files Modified

1. **`lua/termdebug-enhanced/keymaps.lua`**
   - Fixed breakpoint toggle logic
   - Improved "no breakpoints" response handling

2. **`lua/termdebug-enhanced/evaluate.lua`**
   - Added debug logging for popup creation
   - Enhanced error reporting
   - Improved callback verification

3. **`lua/termdebug-enhanced/utils.lua`** (from previous fix)
   - Fixed TermdebugCommand function name
   - Added fallback communication methods

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### **Breakpoint Toggle (F9)**
- First press: Sets breakpoint, shows "Breakpoint X set at file:line"
- Second press: Removes breakpoint, shows "Breakpoint X removed from file:line"
- Works regardless of whether other breakpoints exist

### **Evaluate Feature (K)**
- Shows floating popup with variable value
- Popup appears near cursor
- Auto-closes on cursor movement or Esc
- Shows formatted values (hex/decimal conversion, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### **Still Having Issues?**

1. **Run the debug script**: `:luafile debug_issues.lua`
2. **Check function availability**: Verify TermdebugCommand exists
3. **Test simple popup**: The debug script creates a test popup
4. **Enable verbose logging**: Add debug output to trace execution
5. **Check GDB session**: Ensure debugging is active

### **Common Solutions**

1. **Restart Neovim**: Sometimes helps with plugin state
2. **Reload plugin**: `:lua package.loaded["termdebug-enhanced"] = nil`
3. **Check configuration**: Ensure no keymap conflicts
4. **Verify GDB**: Test GDB commands manually in terminal

The fixes address the core logic issues in both breakpoint toggle and popup creation. The debug logging will help identify any remaining issues.
